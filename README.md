The project was really fun to make. I was not aware of the coingecko api and neither I did know of axios. This is a wonderful tool to make API requests in a lean and concise manner.

THe options api in vue is my favorite way to work. Using the "this" paramenter is sometimes a little confusing but I always end up doing fine using it. I am working on applying the composition API on more of my projects and I will eventually do in the future.

I considered using another gecko api tool taylored for specific to languages like Python (my first programming language) and Node but I felt it could be a distraction and after all axios was serving me so well. Maybe another time.

Media queries are always my achilles heel. It was definitely the hardest part for me. I am aware that me must treat ou projects using the mobile first approach but I end up always working on the desktop version before thinking about applying my media queries. It is something I still struggle and I am working everyday to improve my responsive design habilities.

Whatever the result of my application be I would like to thank you all for the opportunity and the new things I learned by doing this project. 

Best,

Carlos
